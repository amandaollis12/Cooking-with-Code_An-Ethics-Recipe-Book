# Cooking-with-Code_An-Ethics-Recipe-Book
Welcome to a different kind of cookbook, one that feeds the mind, not the stomach.

Each recipe in this collection represents a core ethical principle from the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, written with ingredients, measurements, steps, and notes that mirror traditional cooking instructions.

This project blends creativity with professionalism, turning ethical standards into something engaging, visual, and easy to follow.
